# LaTeX Template

**Remember to change the language in `sty/preamble.sty`**

This template features:
- KOMA-Script
- Very simple `Makefile`
- Compilation files in `aux/` and output files in `out/`, for sanity
- Premade convenience packages
- Booklet production, for producing an a5 booklet to be printed and folded on a4 paper
